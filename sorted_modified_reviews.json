I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. \n\nThe food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker."

I had the omelette skillet and there was hardly any egg in it, I felt like I was eating chopped onions and chopped tomatoes. My wife had a BLT and had a hard time finding the tomato and the avocado that was supposed be on it. Overall,The experience was stressful, mainly because of the long wait."

We were seated right away and the server brought water, coffee and took our orders right away. We waited over 30 mins for breakfast. I got the freebird and came out first before my husband's dish. While it tastes good, it was just potatoes and the spicy sausage gravy was mostly a sauce. There was barely any sausage. My husband got the ny deli omelette that had way too much cheese that it overpowered everything and very little pastrami. Lastly, we were ready to go and our server spent at least 10 mins chatting at another table so I couldn't get our check. I'm not sure if we will return."

My mother and I waited over an hour to get our entrees and our server never apologized for the wait or came to check to see if we needed anything. I ordered the big easy benedict, which was supposed to have chorizo sausage and I literally had maybe 5 small slices of chorizo and the rest of my dish were the eggs and vegetables. Definitely not worth the money. I will give one star for the decor and one star for the manager who did stop by our table to take our drink and food orders when our waitress disappeared and did try to keep an eye on us from time to time. Their servers definitely need some training as well. Two of the people who brought food to our table did not know what dishes they were serving us and said the wrong names when they served our food/drinks. I don't see any reason to go back here."

It took us 10 minutes to have our server acknowledge us once we waited 35 minutes for a table.  It took another 10-15 to get coffee, and were never given cream. We were given a pitcher of water, but had to ask for glasses so we could drink it.  They are understaffed and we visited on a Saturday morning when they were having a special event, so they should have known better! Food was amazing and my fianc\u00e9 loved his coffee!  We definitely got better service at the Warrington location, so if you're thinking about trying this place out I would say go to the Warrington one.  They also have a better waiting area and full counter service area to get coffee while you are waiting!"

Unaware, we went for breakfast when we were in town a few weeks ago. As soon as we were seated I ordered my (what I thought was going to be first of many) White Peach Pear Iced Tea. Big smile on my face - London has great hot tea but crap iced tea...you really have to make it yourself usually over here. At any rate - denied. \nWaitress: \"Uh we don't have that any more.\" \nMe: (checking the menu in disbelief, mouth agape in horror) \"What?!?\" \nHer: \"Yeah, like, I don't know why they did it...it was really popular.\" \nMe: (suspicious it might actually be my own fault given how many refills I always ordered and how often we frequented Turning Point): \"Yeah, doesn't make sense\" \nMy husband: (impatient and not trying to be helpful despite whatever he says) \"Just order something else\"\nMe: (withering glare putting him on notice...thinking that iced tea is the ONLY reason I come to Turning Point so often) \"You order first\"\n\nAfter trial and error I found you CAN order the (available as hot only) White Orchard tea with two accompanying glasses of ice and make your own. But, hell, I might as well be eating breakfast in London slopping the whole table up with tea drippings and condensation. Plus I miss the pure joy of having a perfect White Peach Pear Iced Tea in a takeaway cup to savor while my husband is dawdling his way across Home Depot or something. So yeah, Turning Point - one less star. Take THAT!"

It is low key and welcoming.\n\nFirst thing you see when you walk in is the espresso bar. They have French press options on the menu as well as espresso and the unlimited house coffee options to fill the range of tastes and budgets.\n\nI ordered the huevos rancheros, which came in top of a plate sized tortilla which might have been able to hold itself together as a huge breakfast burrito. If you don't know what huevos rancheros is, think of it as a typical American breakfast of eggs, home fries and sausages (this case chorizo) topped with salsa. In this case they also had a half of an avocado and sour cream. Tasty.\n\nWife has acai berry crepes which were a special. And we ordered two pancakes for the kid. The pancakes weren't special at all, but they weren't bad.\n\nConsidering that it was Mother's Day, the service was great. They even had a large mug as a giveaway to all the mothers. Sadly the one we brought home had a crack when we took off the cellophane. Thankfully we don't need another mug."

Arrived a little after 12p.m. on a perfectly lovely day with four other adult family members. The restaurant makes a nice impression with it's white beadboard trim and large windows. I'm thinking this is going to be nice. We were seated fairly quickly once they had converted a square table to round to accommodate our party of five. The waitress was friendly and attentive at first. Took our orders, poured our beverages etc. Tick, tock, it took 45 minutes before our food was served! If 5 is a big party, they are in big trouble. But the fun doesn't stop there. Out of 5 entrees there were 3 errors. Mom asked for sausage, she got bacon, Sister asked for multi grain bread, she got sour dough, hubby ordered a Tuscany omelet and got a Western. My tuna melt was accurate but miserably cold. Okay let's go with 4 out 5. My brother-in-law was happy with his Cuban. We're still trying to figure out how that happened. My advice, skip it!!!"

I counted 14 waitstaff, four hostess, one guy in black that did nothing, and a manager that liked to talk into his earpiece rather than help.\nThis is a concept restaurant. It has worked before. It isn't working here. So when a waitress tells you \"all our food is made from scratch\" before anythjng else we know the translation is \"our kitchen is very slow, and we won't bd getting your food to you in under an hour.\" Yup. An hour. Not from scratch. Bagels from scratch, no. English muffin, no. Bread, no. Own sausage, no. Smoke the bacon, no. Organic eggs, no. Butter, no. So what did you make from scratch? \nWe ordered french press coffee. It was past brew when it hit the table 15 minutes later. No cream. Ask waitress for cream. Ask manager for cream, he snarked something back, which is what earned this review. Waitress brought cream five minutes later. He couldn't be bothered. Real important stuff going on in that earpiece! \nFood was okay, not great. Coffee was brewed too long. Breads were burned with no butter. Eggs cooked close to order. Sausage and bacon were precooked then put back on (a pet peave of mine). \nWould I ever go back? Maybe. \nOooh, they also have a calculated tip percentage on the bottom for referrence. 25%!!!

We enjoy the North Wales location the most, though Warrington is a close second. Blue Bell only opened recently and has yet to get its act together. Food is good but my favorite is the iced tea. I get the white pear ices tea and they just keep bringing refills - even one to go if I ask!\n\nI'm not going to deduct points from North Wales or Warrington because if you call ahead they get you right into a table but I do want to warn you not to trust calling ahead for the Blue Bell location - egads! One time we called two hours ahead for a table for four people and had to wait close to an hour. Second time we called three hours ahead for a table for six, waited almost two hours. The math for Blue Bell's not working out for me...YMMV. My recommendation: eliminate call ahead for this location or make it work like it does at the other locations."

This was a tough decision to make since the coffee menu was impeccable and almost an entire page itself, but it was a great decision! \n\nFor breakfast there are a variety of options, this includes some of the many healthy ones.

Potatoes were over salted and this dish comes with eggs that were over cooked after asking for over easy created an extremely dry dish. Manager comped our meal but was not very friendly. Felt very sorry for our waiter. He was stuck in the middle.  Other breakfast items were only okay and really nothing to rave about. If this place survives I will be amazed unless they change their kitchen crew. Breakfast really is not that difficult or that hard to make. If you fail miserably at making breakfast you probably will not do well at asking anything more difficult."

I went up to talk to the manager, to try and explain how the other table seated much later were able to get their food before us. My husband left church early just to spend time together and had to return back, so we were trying to accommodate. But instead of apologizing and showing signs of concern, the manager's first comment was \"I can pack in to-go box\". We sat for 1 full hour! Really?\n\nSo when the food came out, we returned the Reuben sandwich, since my husband was now gone, and upset. \n\nWhen we asked for the bill, I got a check for all three orders which was taken care by \"Manger Comp\". \n\nI understand mistakes can happen. But the way the manager dealt with our situation, was very unkind. He should have been more polite and accommodated us more professionally. It was my first time, and I will probably not go back to this place again, unless they have a more established system working around it. \n\nWe went in there with happy mood, sat there waiting for our food for an hour miserably, only to decide to simply eat and go. The \"comp\" check that was brought to us by the server, and not by the manager himself made it that much more upsetting.  This made myself and my daughter feel upset and we left with a sour feeling about the whole place. \n\nI plan to take this up to the corporate manager about how we were served by the server and about how things were handled by the manager!  Terrible first time experience here!!!"

Upon bring seated we were instantly brought a pitcher of water for the table before they took our drink orders, which I thought was a nice touch. We ordered their pumpkin spice lattes which were very tasty. For our entrees we shared these delicious chocolate chip pancakes that were supposed to come topped with strawberries and berry syrup (but we asked for that on the side) and then my friend ordered a bubbie sandwich (pastrami) and I ordered a turkey reuban. The food was delicious, but I must say that I was slightly disappointed that 1 of the slices of bread on my sandwich was half burnt...otherwise the food was fantastic for a restaurant that focuses on breakfast and lunch. The only other complaint I have is that our waitress wasn't very helpful when asked questions about the menu. All in all, Turning Point is definitely a place I'll be returning to in the future."

So although the rest of it tasted pretty good, I would rather have a had a bad tasting meal that didn't have contamination issues. This is pretty unacceptable.\n\nThe manager and the waitress were very apologetic and it was obviously not their personal fault. However, it would be if this repeats. Mistakes happen but the biggest mistake would be if this restaurant didn't make a big deal of this error and fix it in a way it never ever repeats for another customer. I strongly suggest that they educate their staff on vegetarianism and food contamination issues.

They've been open for nearly a year and still can't manage to serve food in a reasonable amount of time.  Literally, every single time we've been there, we've been brought some \"complimentary\" appetizer as an apology for the wait.  Nice gesture, but I'd rather just have my food in a timely manner.\nToday was the worst experience yet.  I ordered the Popeye Skillet (my favorite) with scrambled egg whites.  About 40 minutes after ordering, our table of 6 was served our meals over the course of about 10 minutes and my meal came with regular scrambled eggs.  They took it back and it came out again 10 minutes later -- clearly with the regular eggs scraped off (several bits still remaining), and an unappetizing-looking pile of way undercooked egg whites (which I ended up scraping off and not eating anyway).\nWe were given some free entree cards to come back, but I just don't know if I have it in me to keep going back.  The food is really excellent most of the time, and they have a great menu, but the wait and inaccuracy is ridiculous.  The servers are very nice and they try hard, but the kitchen is absolutely killing them."

This did not make sense to me, but I ordered it.\n\nI waited for about 45 minutes for our food.  I ordered the OMG French toast and it was delicious.  In fact, all of the food coming out of the kitchen looked tasty.\n\nWhen we finally received our check I was surprised to see two charges for the coffee.  One charge ($4.50) for the coffee and one charge ($4.00) for the flavor.  This did not sit right with me and I asked the waitress about it.  She brought over their manager who needs a serious lesson in appropriate manners.  He brought the menu over and tried to show me the prices.  I explained that I understood those prices but that they weren't what I was told.  The manager proceeded to scold me in front of other customers, telling me that I need to read the prices on the menu.  He took the coffee off my check but that wasn't what I was even challenging.\n\nThis place needs some serious help with their customer relations.  It is extremely disorganized, with waitstaff running around, management scolding wait staff in front of customers, and staff arguing with one another in front of customers."

Pumpernick's up the road may not have the atmosphere as here but they do it so much better (and less expensive). \nSo here is my review in more detail...\nGlad to get breakfast at 11:45 weekday where this usually busy restaurant was half full. Coffee was very good...hot and a pot for the table was an added plus. Love that. Waiter was engaging and sweet but extremely forgetful and slow.  Forgot the extra napkins, forgot the water, forgot the water glass and was sloooow to bring the check and even slow to take our order...had to flag him down.  $27 (without tip) seemed rather high for two omelets and 2 coffees.  Especially since the hash brown potatoes  were mostly raw and had horrible tasting seasonings (Should have sent them back).  The English muffin was barely toasted and tasted very doughy.  We asked for jelly...oh that too was initially forgotten, and two small packs were dropped off.  Not quite enough for the two of us but we made it work.  The omelets were more on the fluffy side, tad rubbery, a bit over cooked and made with 3 eggs...I actually prefer a flatter - thinner omelet.  The water glasses and flatware  looked dirty as heavy water spots had to be wiped off.  On a more positive note, it has a very nice front for outside seating and the inside is cute, comfortable and contemporary.  Still...it actually looks like a nice addition to the shopping center.   Just leave yourself extra time when exiting the shopping center...it may take a few traffic lights to get out."

The woman I spoke with on the phone informed me to go on yelp Mother's Day morning, to skip the line and get in the seating rotation.\nSo that's what I did. However all morning I noticed that it was not allowing me to do so. I called the restaurant about an hour and a half before we had expected to go and was informed that they were not using that method today because of the holiday. I was also told that \"they had been telling staff and customers this all week in preparation for the holiday\".\nSo intern I felt like I was being accused of making the initial convo up. I explained how at this point, my family was not going to be able to get in anywhere unless we were willing to wait an hour because I followed the directions given by one of their employees.\nAfter speaking with the manager She was then willing to get us in the seating rotation (after at least 5 min of pleading my case).\nUpon our arrival the table was ready and waiting for us, Yay! And that's where the 1star comes in, and everything else from there went down hill.\nTo start my iced chai was warm, like really warm. I told the waitress (who was sweet) that I had an onion allergy so I was not able to have the potatoes. She said she would talk to the kitchen and sub in sweet potatoes \"that they use to serve\" when my food arrived I was given Salsa and chips. Well salsa has onions. I asked to just have the potatoes because there was no other suggestion and one of my children did not receive her potatoes with her meal so i would just give her mine, i guess they forgot to look at her plate before letting it leave the kitchen. By the time the potatoes arrived everyone was done eating, bummer. \nMy other daughter ordered fruit loops and couldn't even stand the taste of the milk, that's so strange to me. Milk is milk, but she basically gagged every time she took a bite. She's a cereal gal, so it was a bummer to see her disappointment.\nWe didn't want to bother our server anymore as she was clearly running around. \nNot sure if the restaurant was not ready for us, party of 7, or if it was because of the holiday. \nI had talked this chain up so much, and couldn't have been more disappointed with the outcome."

She orders the avocado toast we get two of these and sometimes have eggs and a side. This is a great start to our Sunday mornings. We see other people order bowls and salads but we haven't upgraded to that just yet. This is our favorite place to go on a Sunday and sometimes we sit outside when its a nice day. But anywhere you sit is a great seat. The staff here is so welcoming and everything is very clean. Can't wait to come back with my friends and family."

I have been to the one in Manalapan NJ and LOVE that one but this one where do I start with my dissatisfaction.  The wait even though we had to wait wasn't even an issue for me.  What is an issue for me is the lack of clean tables available when there are people waiting.  Then our server came and gave us menus.  She was quite pleasant but that is about it that I can say positive about her.  She obviously is not experienced she wrote things down but still couldn't bring the correct food out.  She also never checked in on us.  When she gave us the check I gave her my name and phone number so she could look up the Perks card.  She then proceeded to tell me that the card was $10.  HELLO I told you here is my name and phone number so you can apply this visit to my PERKS card.  Are you even paying attention?  \nWell lets talk about the food, if you order food you expect it hot.  You don't expect it lukewarm.  Also The Turning Point in Manalapan makes it a point for the food to LOOK appetizing.  The eggs looked overcooked for Over Easy, the avocado that was on my and my companion's meals looked as brown as the potatoes.  Honestly this was the most disappointing trip to this location and to think I was originally excited when this one opened up in my neighborhood. :("

        "text": "A quick note before the review: This place seems to have the most extreme worst/best reviews I've seen for local breakfast/lunch places. Keep in mind I went on a weekday morning when the restaurant was dead (about 10 AM) and it was just me and a friend, so our orders were small and simple. That would likely change on a weekend, with more people, and as the location continues to grow. Thanks!\n\nDecided to get breakfast here with a friend last Wednesday and really loved it! We were seated quickly and opted for a booth, though tables are also available. Though on the pricier side of breakfast (much more of a brunch place versus a diner breakfast), our portions (I got Grande Huevos Rancheros, he got Eggs Benedetto) were quite large and tasty - and they did not skimp on the avocado for the huevos rancheros (a whole half!) or was also nice to be able to order the eggs any style for the huevos rancheros - I ordered scrambled, which paired nicely with the other ingredients, so I'll be back to try other egg styles with this dish - it's that good!\n\nWhat really stood out was the specialty drinks, even for non-coffee drinkers like myself. We ordered the Reese's Hot Chocolate and Salted Caramel Mochachino to share and really enjoyed both. There is also a large selection of other coffees/coffee drinks, teas, shakes, and smoothies, which we'll also be back for.\n\nService was fast and friendly, and (likely because it was a weekday/there was no line and multiple open tables) didn't rush us out after we finished eating and continued to chat.\n\nCan't wait to go back!"

I finally decided to order the Grande Huevos Rancheros and my sis ordered the Wilber Skillet. We both enjoyed our food; the servings were pretty big and the food arrived quickly, especially considering it was very busy.  Overall, we were glad we gave this new restaurant a try: food is prepared fresh and the prices are very reasonable too. We will definitely return to try something else. Oh, I almost forgot - All customers received a \"New in Town\" 15% discount on their check and the check was delivered to the table by the manager.

We arrived and had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table for 2.  The college kids that are running the front of the house are not very friendly and really need to work on their customer service skills.  After we sat down and I ordered their 2 most popular items (peanut butter pancakes & huevos rancheros), it took 45 minutes for our food to arrive.  Before this we noticed that the water tasted like it was from the toilet and that the creamer container was disgustingly dirty.  The food quality was also poor.  The bacon was burnt, the pancakes were just edible, the huevos rancheros consisted of mainly potatoes instead of eggs and good stuff, and most disappointing was the huge black hair in this dish (see pic).  My wife made a quick visit to the gross bathroom before departure.  We could not get out of this place fast enough, my advice is to skip this place altogether if possible!"

There is a good amount of shopping in this area with the Montgomeryville Mall down the street and The Shoppes at English Village (which include a brand new Sephora) where Turning Point is also located. This is a fast growing franchise with three other locations in PA and a new location coming soon to Newtown, PA area.\n\nWhat I love about this place:\n\nFrench Press Coffee! If you have not had it, your missin' out.  Kenyan, Hawaiian Kona, Costa Rican, and Jamaican Blue Mountain.  They serve in a large french press carafe enough for two with a rock candy sugar stick (even though I smuggle in a napkin home for the kids) super cute.\n\nExtensive breakfast and brunch list waffles, pancakes, french toast, egg skillets, avocado toast, the list goes on. My favorite is the Popeye skillet and the Wilbur Skillet extra avocado. Lunch options are savory sandwiches, salads, and create your own combo with 1/2 sandwich, soup, or 1/2 salad (choice of two).\n\nOutdoor Eating:\n\nThey have a great patio area out front so on a sunny day enjoy your coffee with some fresh air. \n\nWhat could be a little better:\n\nThe wait time can be brutal and there is no calling ahead so if you are a big party or in a rush...don't get your britches in a bundle cause your gunna wait. Grab a cup of FREE coffee in the waiting area and stare at your phone or perhaps have a conversation. Its a good sized bright space with lots of natural light. Just realize that you may have to have some patience.\n\nOverall a great spot. I've eaten here several times with the family and I'm sure we will be back for several more!"

I'm sure a Sat+Sun here is crazy crowded.\n\nOur waitress offered to make a table for us and immediately brought over lemon water for everyone. Besides water I ordered an ice coffee. It was pretty good and fairly strong. My niece ordered the Summer Raspberry Spritzer and loved it. It was served with a mint ice cube as well. had plenty of time looking over the menu and let me tell ya, everything looks awesome. Literally everything. So many different options including a good amount on the 'healthier' side.\n\nWe started off with the Bacon Lollipops, but they unfortunately came out with the entrees. Although I didn't indulge in any they looked crazy good. Presentation on point as well. Entrees ordered: \nChop Chop Salad, Shrimp Tacos, Traditional Eggs, and I ordered the Pesto Infusion Skillet filled with tomatoes, avocado, and portobellos. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I especially loved mine and definitely recommended it if you like egg whites. There are tons of Turning Point locations so I highly suggest stopping by one of you ever get the chance!"

I'm thinking this is going to be nice. We were seated fairly quickly once they had converted a square table to round to accommodate our party of five. The waitress was friendly and attentive at first. Took our orders, poured our beverages etc. Tick, tock, it took 45 minutes before our food was served! If 5 is a big party, they are in big trouble. But the fun doesn't stop there. Out of 5 entrees there were 3 errors. Mom asked for sausage, she got bacon, Sister asked for multi grain bread, she got sour dough, hubby ordered a Tuscany omelet and got a Western. My tuna melt was accurate but miserably cold.

I live in ambler so I was so happy to see one opening less than 10 min down the street from me. This morning I went around noon and was horribly disappointed. \nThere was no wait and I was seated right away, the waitress was very nice, I ordered a Wilbur skillet with poached eggs and an iced coffee. The coffee came pretty quick and then in a reasonable amount of time my skillet showed up. \nMy \"poached eggs\" that had a yolk that was harder than the yolk of a hard boiled egg were sitting atop some dry ass potatoes with cheese that had crusted over. I grab the waitress and told her the eggs were beyond overcooked. She asked if I wanted new ones and I said just bring me 2 poached eggs. She said no problem and she would have the \"manger\" come over. Before he did the waitress brought me out a new order of poached eggs. This time, comically, they were the same as the fist batch....hard boiled!! At this time the manager, who looked like a disheveled man who had no clue, came over to tell me I wouldn't be charged for my skillet. I said I hope not and by the way this isn't a poached egg either and showed him my replacement egg. He said yeah i guess that is a little overbooked and WALKED AWAY! Great manager. \nI felt bad for the waitress who tried her best to cover for all the mess ups. But after 2 failed attempts I ended up leaving hungry. Basically you would be better off eating elsewhere."

After waiting for 25 min to be seated, the server spills coffee on us within min of being seated. The server complains that he burnt himself with no acknowledgment that he hit both myself and my guest, including getting it all over my guests pants. 20 min later he finally comes back to take our order. We waited for 40 min and never recieved our food. The server finally comes out and says the messed up the order and are remaking it. The manager comes out says they will comp the food, but we can pay for the coffee (that was spilled on us!) We waited an additional 20 min and still did not get our food. People that had been seated after us were served and leaving at this point! At least 10 tables were served while we waited. We finally got up after an hour and told them we were leaving. They still made us pay for the coffee...$12.10!!\nWill never return!"

        "text": "This was my first time at Turning Point; my sister and I had a day of brunch and shopping planned, so despite the reviews suggesting poor service, I decided we would give this place a shot. The poor service reviews were definitely accurate. When I checked Yelp just before 10, the wait time was only 5 minutes, so I decided we didn't need to join the wait list. We arrived at 10:30 and were told the wait was 30 minutes, so we decided to wait. The only reason we did so was because on the patio, about 8 of the 10 tables were empty, so we thought the wait would be shorter than 30 minutes. We also specified that we wouldn't mind sitting outside if that was first available. This was a pleasant, sunny, 75 degree Sunday morning, so we thought it was very odd that people were not being seated on the patio. We moved up to 12th in line on the wait list, and there were still just as many empty tables available on the patio--it seemed like no one was being seated out there, but there was no explanation given. At one point a couple just walked right up and sat down on the patio, they didn't give their name for the wait list or see the front desk first, just helped themselves. The waitress seemed to be telling them they shouldn't have done that, but then she took their orders and served them. Another couple walked up and greeted the waitress (without going inside first) and she sat them right down on the patio--at that point my sister and I started to wonder if you had to be friends with that waitress to get one of the many open tables on the patio. \nOur wait was a little over 30 minutes, and when our table was ready, they called the completely wrong name--I had to confirm it was me using my phone number; I would've gladly spelled my name if they had asked. We had already checked out the menu, so we ordered and our food was served pretty quickly. The food is amazing--my sister got the pesto skillet with veggies and egg whites, I got the yogurt granola bowl, and we shared the pumpkin pancakes because they just looked and sounded irresistable--and they were! \nOur server cleared some plates and left our check, and then disappeared. We kept looking for him, trying to get his attention, but he wasn't coming anywhere near our table. We waited so long that we actually thought maybe we were supposed to pay up front, so we walked up to pay, only to be told \"you pay with your server\". At one point he went outside, and when he finally came back in we were able to flag him down and pay. \nAll in all, food was great, service was poor. I don't mind waiting if it's clearly busy, but when there are at least 8 open tables (cleaned off also) and no one is being seated there, the wait seems unnecessary. And the wait to pay was ridiculous--we wanted to get to the rest of our day and were held up for over 15 minutes just to pay the check. Keep the menu, fix the service! Until I see some reviews that show improved service, I won't go back."

I got one of the egg skillets which sounded really good but was also very unsatisfying. The eggs were dry and the potatoes lacked flavor. follow through is not great here. Don't get your hopes up.

        "text": "Everyone has been taking about this cute new little place in North Wales called the Turning Point.  This is actually our 2nd time there and the first experience was ok, and we realize there are kinks they need to work out so figured this time it would be great since it still gets packed right? Wrong!!!!\n\nOnly thing turning here is my stomach.  I ordered the NY Deli omelet and if anyone knows anything about NY Delis they give you a shitload of food.  Girlfriend ordered a No Yolks About It omelet.  \n\nWaitress was very nice and she felt bad and offered us snacks 45 minutes after we ordered.   We asked for straws for our water and after about 15 more minutes we asked someone else.  After another 10 minutes I got them myself.  I guess straws can be confusing.  Not to mention every single server and hostess looks under 21 and the General Manager snapping his fingers at people and wasn't very helpful\n\n So after almost an hour we got our food.  My egg whites were clearly not egg whites and do you think they gave a decent amount of pastrami?  Nope!  There was enough pastrami in there to not please my cat.  They put the cheese on top to probably hide the fact that it was scrambled.  Additionally the potatoes, which I asked to be extra crispy were soft enough for a 130 year old person with no teeth to eat.  \n\nThe no yolks omelet comes with a hint of cheese.  There was enough cheese to satisfy a horse.  Also fresh salsa, which was hiding in the omelet and not fresh.  We would have sent it back but probably been there another hour.  \n\nGot the check with our food and asked about the 15% discount for my development and the person at the cash register looked at me like I have two heads.  Then she grabbed the waitress for me to pay since I can't pay at the register.  Still left 20% tip.  Not totally her fault and she was nice.  \n\nOverall, this place might be a cute little spot in a shopping center with Trader Joe's, Harvest and Iron Hill, but it is actually the asshole of the shopping center.  Save your money and stick with Pumpernicks if you are looking for breakfast in North Wales."

It seems like every time the servers and management don't coordinate well. Now let me just say, we have been to turning point (in different locations) multiple times with friends and just by ourselves. So we know what to expect from the food, and how it should taste.\nNow that being said...\n\nThis time we went the server was very pleasant and took our drink order first.  It wasn't until about 20 minutes later that our server came back around to take our entree orders. The coffee for my husband came out quick (it should..hello coffee). I still had not received my latte drink from the drink bar. When it finally came out it was the wrong drink. I knew it was because the server who brought it out said, \" Coffee?\" I ordered the nutty Irishmen latte (which is a wonderful drink) which is not a coffee. So when I was told it was a coffee, I said that I had ordered a different drink. The server told me, \"yea it's what you ordered\" \nI took one sip of it and knew it was wrong. It was a coffee. So rather than talk to our server and wait another 30 minutes to get a drink,\nI went up to the bar personally and asked if it had certain ingredients in it that my drink was suppose to have. The server at the bar stated he had made it with almond milk just like I wanted. I then asked again if he had made the drink I wanted (the nutty Irishmen) and he finally said no it's a coffee. I don't know where the miss communication was, but for me to have to go back to the coffee barista who made my drink, and for him to continue to tell me that my drink was made right, and that I was wrong, really annoyed me. I'm sorry but I have been to turning points (in multiple locations) enough times to know what my drink is suppose to taste/look like. \n\nAnother note with this location, the servers had to clean there own tables which slowed the process of getting a table when we first came in. The manager or front house hostess (whatever their title is) didn't do a great job of helping out the servers. At one point I saw him sitting on the floor behind the cashier/hostess desk on his phone. I have never owned a restaurant business, but I know well enough that if you aren't busy, and tables need to get cleaned...help out! Team work makes the dream work, and your customers happy. \n\nOur time frame from sitting down at the table to finally finishing up our meals was about an hour/maybe a little longer. Usually when it's just my husband and I we are out/done eating in 45 minutes. Thank goodness we weren't in a hurry to go anywhere.\n\nSo to anyone who is willing to wait a while and possibly not get the right food/drink you can come here. My recommendation is to go to a different turning point. This location has been awful the past 4-5 times we have been there."

I took my 2 young sons there, a few months ago, and we waited for an hour, in a basically empty place, for food AND drinks.  I figured maybe the staff was newer, which is why we went back this time. Nope.   It's WORLDS different between the two locations.  The ONLY redeeming factor is that their drinks are pretty cool.  They really need to get it together. They're like the before photo of a weight loss commercial, and Warrington is the after.  Trust me, go to the other location."

The restaurant is quite crowded around 10-11 am on the weekend or holidays so I recommend making an reservation if you have a large party. They have so many options and are known for their pancakes. Their clean juices are pretty good but their food is alright. The dishes are decently sized but quite heavy so I'd recommend sharing one. Their pancakes are what you expected out of a standard pancake. Their omelets are quite bland so I don't recommend getting them. \n\n*VERDICT*\nI probably would not go back again unless someone asks me to."

Luckily the food is good and I don't mind sitting around waiting with friends, it usually makes up for the bad service. Two days ago I went with a friend and it was just abysmal. First we were standing waiting to be sat for aprox 5 minutes even though there were at least 10 empty tables and the waiters just kept walking right past us. Eventually someone sat us in between a slew of dirty uncleared tables. The tables stayed dirty the entire time we were there. It was unsightly and unsanitary and generally not good for the atmosphere. It appeared as if the waiters working were having some type of spat over who was taking what tables and it showed. We waited patiently as we enjoyed just sitting and talking but I noticed 2 other tables complaining about the wait. I noticed a table that was sat before mine didn't have water or coffee well after I got mine. Eventually our food came out and was TASTY! I had a nice time but overall this restaurant just does not seem to know how to get their act together. \n\n\nIt is very clearly a MANAGEMENT problem. The waiters working appeared to be working hard and doing their best but were mismanaged."

Although they made a mistake of giving me vegan omelette without vegetables so they gave me another one that's why I have 2 pictures. COMPARE THE DIFFERENT OMELETTES. The new omelette with veggies is just like a real omelette with real eggs it's scary it feels like they gave me real eggs but the waiter said it's vegan. Waitress was very busy so I can't keep on asking her. I'm very skeptical about it. It felt like I was eating veggie omelette with real eggs. Love the area and the vibe of this location. There was a wait on the tables so we sat at the bar which is nice too... love their soy latte as well.. so fresh.. vegan omelette came with toast but it had butter so I didn't eat it. Clean bathrooms."

First, I got my birthday breakfast for free with the \"perks\" card. I almost felt guilty not paying for it, because \"The Big Easy Benedict\" was unbelievably delicious. It was an incredible blend of flavors and textures - the eggs were perfectly poached, there was just the right amount of cornbread, the onions and creole spice added some variety, the Chorizo was not too hot or too mild, and the Hollandaise sauce was absolutely lovely. The side of fried potatoes was very good too, though it was tough to finish them all. During the meal, the chef came out to ask how it was. I found out that he only started two weeks ago. Apparently, they made a really good hire!\n\nI also got some white-leaf tea with it, which always comes with a stirring stick of crystallized sugar and a cute little doily (so nice!). My son got a Reese's hot chocolate and waffles, which would be hard NOT to enjoy.\n\nThough the prices tend to be a smidge higher than your average diner, it's the perfect place to feel very fancy and have very high-quality food without spending nearly as much as you would at a high-scale restaurant for dinner."

        "text": "First time visiting this establishment.  North wales is lacking in regards to places that serve breakfast and brunch .  Pumpernickel is terrible and Metropolitan's dinner menu is much better then their brunch.  Honestly this place just comes off as a breath of fresh air.  Upon entering most of the staff appear to be very young however, they were very professional.  They must of went through the rigorous chick fil a training.  Well done Turning Point.  We placed a call ahead reservation and when we arrived we were seated pretty fast around 11:30 AM.   Me and my Wife tried the French press coffee.  This is a first for me and I am a huge coffee lover.  The 32 ounces was more then enough and I would certainly order it again.  When I try a new restaurant especially for brunch the omelette is the first thing that draws my attention.  I ordered the key west omelette and switched out the sausage for turkey bacon.  I was very impressed.  Fluffy and loaded with huge shrimps and turkey bacon.  I like to order a side of salsa and sour cream and they came out in two large bowls, without a bother of me asking for more.  This place does not skimp out on portions and I love it.  On a negative note my sons French toast was not impressive.  The restaurant should consider using Texas toast or brioche bread for their French toast.  My wife stated The Turning point in cherry hill makes an amazing French toast.  I wish I had a picture to post but maybe next time will be better.    My omelette came with home fries from the frozen isle.  I hate frozen potatoes!  Nothing beats a potato made from scratch with fried onions and peppers.  These home fries were blan with no seasoning.  Not terrible enough to drop to a 3 star.  Everything can't be perfect. Great experience, great food, great customer service.  We will be back."

It seems to me that Turning Point is really working on improving their customer service, and it's coming up to par with the high quality food. My friend and I walked in and were seated immediately and immediately offered coffee or another beverage. Our waitress checked on us multiple times, took our order quickly and the food came out shortly after. I got a skillet breakfast which was perfectly crispy and tasty. My friend got the breakfast nachos which were huge and delicious - the chorizo is so good! I highly recommend coming to Turning Point for a delicious breakfast in a great atmosphere with good service."

We were given the recommendation for Turning Point so off we went! \nWe were seated right away. I guess we hit that sweet spot for breaking our fast. There was a good crowd for Xmas Eve and most were donning masks. The servers all had masks on.\nWhen you walk in you notice right away the hip and fresh decor. It's very bright and cheery with cheeky signs (my fav was for the Employees only sign where you are threatened with indentured servitude)\nThe menu is a usual take on breakfast, but is also the reason I am only giving 4 stars. There were a lot of MEALS offered, but nothing light for those of us that don't like huge breakfasts. Here they WILL feed you.\nThere are no cold cereals, no options of a bagel or English muffin with jam. You will have eggs, pancakes, french toast or the crunchy granola fare of avocado toast or vegan eggs etc. I'm not a big breakfast fan so I got a small stack of plain pancakes while my mother got her usual eggs and toast.\nThe pancakes were cold. Not ice cold...but not hot. They had obviously been sitting outside of a heat lamp. They weren't fluffy but neither were they dense. They just were. The eggs were on the hard scramble side but the toast looked good. The bacon was really good \nSide note...they didn't spring for the real maple syrup which I found odd in a hipster dining place \nThe coffee, imo, was very strong. Not bitter, just very strong. It wasn't the best coffee but they leave you with a pitcher of it. They also leave a pitcher of water.\nThe prices were pretty standard for the area and the staff ranged from friendly to 'too cool for school'. It is a holiday so I am being very lenient...but these children have to remember they are in the service industry. That means you will work holidays. So put a smile on that face!!\nAll in all, it was a cute spot to have breakfast and we left replete."

You get two pancakes of each selection and my favorite was hands down the Bourbon Walnut Banana which has alot going on but do not be afraid to redip that bourbon flavored pancake in the maple syrup. The Cinnamon pancake has a cheese frosting on it detailed in the picture and I can say I never had such a unique pancake. The Berry Chocolatey pancake was my least favorite as it had a bittersweet dark chocolate flavor to it and I feel most pancake fanatics will criticize. You can however choose one of there other options like the lemon blueberry pancake option.\n\nThis breakfast joint has spectucular coffee options including French Press coffee for an upcharge of $7.25 per pot if you want to splurge. I have gotten the OMG french toast here before again you are getting a meal full of sugar but they have a whole list of healthy options as well.\n\nI will be back to this establishment and highly recommend you venture into The Turning Point if you are a virgin to the experience.

We were told the wait for two was about 45 minutes (!) or we could try waiting for a spot at the cafe bar (about 6 seats in total). We ended up taking the loss in the wait and just going to Trader Joe's nearby for some shopping. \n\nAfter about an hour, we were seated and served. The coffee and drinks come out very quickly, but our food did take some time. I ordered the Wilbur Skillet and she got the Western Omelet. We did expect the food to be relatively fast, given how simple it seemed to be, but it took a bit longer than expected. The staff was super friendly and probably the main reason I'm giving this place an extra star. They made sure we were taken care of and remade the omelet for my girlfriend when the salt shaker broke over her dish. While the food wasn't anything too special, the service was top notch and made our experience extremely delightful. \n\nI highly recommend joining the waitlist from yelp or calling in, as 45min-1 hour is rough on a weekend. All in all, it was a nice time on a Sunday afternoon!"

It was never really attentive and fast service to begin with, but it was unfortunately extra sub-par this time around. Our waitress was not very friendly and we had to wait quite a while for basic things (like water and coffee... and then waiting even more for creamer). And then obviously that foreshadowed the slowness before getting our actual meal. Not only was it a slow experience, but our waitress never once checked up on us, asked us if we needed anything, apologized for the slow service, and she didn't even acknowledge us at times. Please improve your customer service because most of your food is pretty good. Also, I did enjoy my sweet potato hash, but it was different than the last time I got it... unfortunately, the sweet potatoes were mushy rather than formed and they were seasoned with cinnamon which was rather odd and it wasn't that way the last time I got it.\nOne positive thing is that they do have a variety on their menu, including vegan options... and also that the restaurant itself is clean and aesthetically pleasing. Food looks good and it tastes pretty good for the most part, but also there were a few things lacking it was nothing special during this visit."
