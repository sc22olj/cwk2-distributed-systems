Sentiment analysis for business reviews
- Use google, tripadvisor and trustpilot review APIs to collate reviews of a business into a central database
- For large businesses, it may be hard to read over all reviews. We need a way of analysing them quickly
- Any time the database is updated, a function performs sentiment analysis on the last 15 (adjustable) reviews, allowing the 
business owner to get insight into problems quickly
- Also classify the problematic reviews into categories

Benefits
- Allows collation of reviews from multiple sources
- Allows quick insight into problems without needing to read every review
